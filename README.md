# TODO #
* Using IS42S16160 which is actually 32MB SDRAM, there must be 13 bit address (A0-A12). But I only populated 12-bit (A0-A11). Fix This
* Move the LCD FPC 40P slightly inside the PCB in order to match the actual LCD bend.
* Add VBUS control to the USB C in order to use USB Host capability
* I forgot to route 5V to 4P the JST-XH connector
* Rotate the ST-Link connector 180 degree to match the actual ST-Link connector bend
